This workflow can be used for the following:

+ Identify RNA transcripts using either cDNA or direct RNA reads.
+ Reference aided transcriptome assembly.
+ Annotation of assembled transcripts.
+ Gene fusions detection.
+ Differential gene expression analysis using a pre-computed or assembled reference transcriptome.
+ Differential transcript usage analysis using a precomputed or assembled reference transcriptome.
